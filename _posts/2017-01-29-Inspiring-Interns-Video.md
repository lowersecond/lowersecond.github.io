Hi, 

My name is Thomas Green and I graduated from the University of Nottingham with a 2:2 Hons degree in Biochemistry. 

My degree has given me the ability to interrogate and understand complex biological processes, as well as the ability to assemble an pursuasive argument and engage in debate on a wide variety of topics. 

My  experience working within the NHS, in both the lab and ward environement has greatly developed my ability to work cohesively within a large team to deliver a high quality of service under pressure.

Working within the NHS has given me exposure to a wide variety of people from all backgrounds, this has allowed me to greatly develop my inter-personal and communication skills. 

I am passionate about Digital media and technology, and since graduating I have continued to develop my skills by learning computer programming and web design languages such as HTMl, CSS and Javascript. 

I know the benifits of both determination and hard work, having raced in both triathlons and half marathons. Both of which demonstrate my drive and my competitive spirit. 

During my free time I also enjoy Show Jumping, downhill skiing and Sailing. All of which have helped develop me into the well-rounded individual I am today. 

Thankyou
